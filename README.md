## About
Normanbot is a simple Discord bot allowing adding new commands as plugins with ease. Its personality is inspired by the great mind of Donald Norman (*). It is meant to be a rather simple bot with some necessary basic functionality but very easy extensibility. Normanbot can be easily extended with plugins where users can create their own commands.

(*) Why? Don't ask, it started as an inside university joke.
