## About
Norman Bot is a simple Discord bot allowing adding new commands as plugins with ease. Its personality is inspired by the great mind of Donald Norman (*). It is meant to be a rather simple bot with some necessary basic functionality but very easy extensibility. Norman Bot can be easily extended with plugins where users can create their own commands. And don't worry, if you don't mind about the great Donald Norman, you may easily change the bot's personality to match your (_bad_) taste.

_(*) Why? Don't ask, it started as an inside university joke. Anyhow, [Donald Norman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Norman) is inspirational teacher, researcher and writer and you should familiarise youself with his work!_
